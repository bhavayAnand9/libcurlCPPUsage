# libcurlCPPUsage
cpp program using libcurl library for sending a GET request to an API.

Usage : 

well in most of the mac systems libcurl is already installed so to test if it's installed type `curl` in your terminal and just make sure no error is thrown. If in case an error is thrown follow below steps.

for macos install libcurl using command (NOTE: make sure homebrew already installed on your system)
`brew install libcurl`

I'm assuming you already know how to use XCode IDE and linking binary files with your program in Xcode cpp project environment. so go on and link it.

click on run and there you go.
